# Mibomi

*Lonami's Bot for Minecraft*, or my attempt at implementing
the current version of [wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg) in Python 3.

The current implementation works for Minecraft 1.12.2 (protocol version 340).

* Run tests by doing `python -m unittest`.
* Refer to [`docs/`](docs/) for documentation.
* Refer to [`testbots/`](testbots/) for code examples.
